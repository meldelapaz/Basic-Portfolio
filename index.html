	<p>"Where are you from?" Here we go... I was born in Puerto Rico, grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and I am currently attending Rollins College in Winter Park. My mother is from Venezuela and my father is from Miami. My extened family is spread out accross the world. So I guess you could say I'm from everywhere.</p>
